# Spark

An ambient lighting system built using Arduino, several LED strips and Java.
Sadly I could not spend as much time on this project as I wanted so it's more of
a proof of concept project with some low-quality code, I wouldn't suggest
reusing it anywhere. `spark-arduino` directory contains the source code for
the Arduino project and `spark-java` contains all Java source code which is
meant to be run on the machine directly connected to an Arduino.

[This YouTube video](https://youtu.be/V-m6wq622P0) shows the system in action
and you can check out [my blog](https://foxypanda.me/spark/) for some more info.
